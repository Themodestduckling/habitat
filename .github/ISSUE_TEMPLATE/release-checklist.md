Here are all the steps for the release process. Create a new issue at the beginning and check them off as you go. This issue exists to track progress on the release and ensure all the steps are carried out. When you're done just close the issue.

As you encounter discrepancies between this list and reality, or as you encounter problems with a release, please add a comment to this issue with a checklist of these things, and add to it as the release progresses. This will give you a list of things to update at the end, as well as provide a historical record of what happened, which can help us drive improvements in the future. As you fix things or file formal issues, please add the relevant links back to the checklist item that triggered it to provide further context.
